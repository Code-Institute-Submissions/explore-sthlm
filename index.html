                <h1>The City</h1>
                Stockholm is the capital and most populous urban area of Sweden as well as in Scandinavia. 
                1 million people live in the municipality, approximately 2 million in the urban area,
                and 2.4 million in the metropolitan area.
                The city stretches across fourteen islands where Lake Mälaren flows into the Baltic Sea. 
                Outside the city to the east, and along the coast, is the island chain of the Stockholm archipelago. 
                The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 
                1252 by Swedish statesman Birger Jarl.
                Stockholm is the cultural, media, political, and economic centre of Sweden. The city is home to some of Europe's top ranking universities, such as 
                the Stockholm School of Economics, Karolinska Institute and KTH Royal Institute of Technology. It hosts 
                the annual Nobel Prize ceremonies and banquet at the Stockholm Concert Hall and Stockholm City Hall.
                The Stockholm metro, opened in 1950, is well known for the decor of its stations; it has been called the longest 
                art gallery in the world.
                Stockholm is the seat of the Swedish government and most of its agencies, including the highest courts in the judiciary,
                and the official residencies of the Swedish monarch and the Prime Minister. Stockholm Palace is the official residence and principal workplace of the Swedish monarch, while 
                Drottningholm Palace, a World Heritage Site on the outskirts of Stockholm, serves as the Royal Family's private residence.
